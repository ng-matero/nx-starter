            The Labrador Retriever, also Labrador, is a type of retriever-gun dog. The Labrador is
            one of the most popular breeds of dog in the United Kingdom and the United States.

            A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently
            trained to aid the blind, those who have autism, to act as a therapy dog and perform
            screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies. They are
            prized as sporting and hunting dogs.

            A few kennels breeding their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England.
            At the same time, a combination of the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and
            rabies
            quarantine in the United Kingdom, led to the gradual demise of the St. John's water
            dog
            in Canada.

            In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord
            John Scott, had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for
            use as gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador
            Retrievers
            as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for their
            expertise in waterfowling.

            During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and the 12th
            Earl
            of Home collaborated to develop and establish the modern Labrador breed. The dogs
            Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with
            bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th
            Earl
            of Home. The offspring are considered to be the ancestors of modern Labradors.
